# SCS_PenTest_Tool
Python tool with scripts for running pentests.
This tool is to be a combination of tools that are scripted to run automatically
or with minimal user input so that the user does not need to remember every switch.
This v1 does not yet have the scripts built-in so please do not expect every button to work
as this project is still very much in the early stages and incomplete.

If you have any ideas of how I can improve this please reach out to me by e-mail at
